# EV-Sales-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-SAS
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) sales data using SAS.
The dataset, containing sales figures across different regions and years, is imported and examined through various SAS procedures. The goal is to explore key statistics, identify trends, and visualize the sales data to understand the growth and distribution of EV sales over time.


# Analysis:

Data Importation:
The EV sales data is imported into SAS from a CSV file. The dataset is prepared for analysis by ensuring the variable names are correctly assigned.

Data Exploration:
Initial exploration of the dataset is performed using procedures such as PROC PRINT to view a sample of the data and PROC CONTENTS to examine the structure and attributes of the dataset.

Statistical Analysis:
Descriptive statistics are calculated using PROC MEANS, allowing for an understanding of key metrics such as averages and missing values within the dataset.

Missing Data Analysis:
The dataset is checked for any missing values using PROC MEANS with the NMISS option to ensure data quality and completeness.

Visualization:
A trend analysis is visualized using PROC SGPLOT, where a series plot is created to represent EV sales trends by region over the years. This provides insights into how EV sales have evolved across different regions.
